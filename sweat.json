Also, In my opinion, this is probably one of the worst places DBD has ever been in. Killer is even more of a chore to play, and incredibly stressful! MMR doesn't help either, because it's actually incorrect in its grading, every game is sweatfest or sleepfeast. Real shame that you need to play meta killers or be a comp player to win consistently at high MMR."
